# openmp test

This is a small and simple test of using OpenMP on systems with GNU compiler.  The gcc compiler and
openmp libraries are required.  It was developed on Centos 6.

C code by John Burkardt was taken from https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/c_src/prime_openmp/prime_openmp.html
who has a fantastic collection of example parallel codes in several languages.

See the  script  thread_test.sh to compile and run a test of the program.  You can run it as

bash thread_test.sh
